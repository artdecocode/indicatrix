## API

The package is available by importing its default function:

```js
import indicatrix from 'indicatrix'
```

%~%

```## async indicatrix => *
[
  ["text", "string"],
  ["promise", "Promise|() => Promise"],
  ["options?", "Options"]
]
```

When called from the CLI application, `indicatrix` will print the supplied text and draw the ellipsis (`.` > `..` > `...` > `.`) animation at the end, until the promise is resolved.

## `INDICATRIX_PLACEHOLDER` env

When the `INDICATRIX_PLACEHOLDER` is set to anything other than `0`, the package won't print the `...` ellipsis, but append the static `<INDICATRIX_PLACEHOLDER>` string to the loading text instead. This is used by [documentary](https://artdecocode.com/documentary/) to add an interactive placeholder:

<fork>example</fork>
